# Pidgeon
Web based interface for the Pidgeon Acid Rain prediction system.

Allows to view data obtained through machine learning with pH readings from a reader designed for dew measurements for up to date condensed water vapour pH measurements

# Starting The Website
Starting the webserver is fairly simple. You'll need to have PHP installed as a prerequisite, and that's all for now (I think...)
Once you've configured php to correlate with your environment variables, just run your corresponding shell script (.sh for unix, .bat for windows).
* The manual command to run the website is
`` php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 ``
